## DOM XSS

### Exploit steps

1. Click on the search bar at the top of the screen
2. Enter the malicious code `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`

- Note: To exploit this, I also tried several input areas, but found that the vulnerability was located in the search bar.

### Explanation

The vulnerability is that there is no input validation in the search bar. When a user types in an item to search, and presses enter, you can inspect the HTML of the resulting page under the 'Elements' tab of developer tools. It contains the following:

`<span ... id="searchValue"><iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">...</iframe></span>`

The input was not validaded, and the 'iframe' tax was treated as valid HTML, and because of this, its Javascript was able to be executed.

### Patch

There are a couple of ways you could go about this. If you were writing a website in plain HTML and JavaScript, and didn't have a library or framework with added security features, you could use HTML and Javascript encoding with the 'node-esapi' encoder package. However, this code uses the Angular web development framework, which I learned that it has security built in by default. This means that it should be validating input automatically, and that something must have been turned of. In the patch section that follows, I reveal where this vulnerability takes place (we are wrongly bypassing Angular security and trusting the text without validation).

### Patch code

```
6	-	      this.searchValue = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(queryParam)
6	+	      this.searchValue = queryParam
```
